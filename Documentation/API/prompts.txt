using Notebook LM...

I can just change the TYPE to drivers, or sensors or whatever. It doesn't care that the example is for sensors, it works anyway. Thank you inference!

>>
give me an API for the [TYPE]. each class should be level 3 heading. the methods and properties should be bullets. provide an index at the top like this:
## Index
- [Sensors](#sensors)
    - [AnalogSensor](#analogsensor)
