# Powder Of Life

**Powder Of Life is a multi-environmental framework for creating interactive objects and installations.** This open-source library provides a modular and extensible system for connecting sensors, actuators, and creative coding environments.

The core of Powder Of Life is the **Neuron** class, representing a single element in the system. Specialized **Neuron** subclasses, like **Sensor**, **Driver**, **Generator**, and **Node**, provide a standardized way to interface with various hardware components and data streams. 

[See the API](API/README.md) for the specific subclasses and their available methods.
