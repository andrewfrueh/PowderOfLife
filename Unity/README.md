# Powder Of Life, for Unity

The POL framework was originally created in Unity. It grew out of the collection of examples developed while teaching Unity as a tool for building interactive art works. 

Unfortunately, this code base is also quite old relative to the Arduino environment library. There is much restructuring that needs to be done. The examples work as expected, and most components are fully functional and bug free. But be buyer be ware, all code is provided "as-is". 

* Download and install "PowderOfLife.unitypackage"
* Navigate to the "Example Scenes" folder
* Find one you like and disect it (notes are provided)
